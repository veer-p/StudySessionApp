# Veer's Project - Personal Wiki

### Background
Everyday millions of people around the world lose someone they love dearly.
Along with that person we lose a wealth of stories, from early life to adulthood, to their
personal history, successes, failures, controversies, and unique perspectives on the world at large. 

I want to create software that will allow my family and friends to 
document, read, and own their personal history; archiving each page for posterity, 
and more specifically, the benefit of subsequent generations.

### Project Information

This project will be a Java GUI where a user can create their own personal wiki article.
Each article will be generated using user-specific responses to a series of generated prompts and 
users may write to their preferred length for each. If anything changes, these topics along with personal
information will be editable. After they are satisfied, they can read their own page with the completed sections.
In the future, I would like to add the option to add additional profiles, create new sections, and enable 
the possibility to search for these loved ones' profiles to learn more about them through the lens of 
their personal Wiki.


### *User Stories*

- As a user, I want to be able to add information to each section in my Personal Wiki page
- As a user, I want to be able to edit my article entries in case of error
- As a user, I want to be able to see my completed page
- As a user, I want to be able to see the profile's age based on their birthdate
