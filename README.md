# Veer's Project - Study Session App

### Background
As university students, studying is integral to our success. As such, it must be that we keep close track of our study 
sessions, including factors such as their length, efficiency, and time, in order to consistently keep track of our 
study habits. The study habits that we build in the early years of university form the basis of how we learn for the 
rest of our lives, and thus, we should see that the foundation is built strong through rigorous tracking of key
metrics, resources for posterity and optimize our time accordingly.

I want to create software that will allow me and my university classmates to document each one of their study 
sessions and keep a log of all of their sessions with key information about each one.

### Project Information

This project will be a Java GUI where a user can create their own personal study session log.
Each session will be filled out using user-specific responses to a series of generated prompts regarding
details such as topic of study, start and end times, resources used as well as if they feel they've mastered
the material. They can then view all their previous sessions inclusive as well as see their personal efficiency in each 
session, and their overall mastery rate. Once they are satisfied in adding new sessions, they can view a complete
summarized history of their sessions in hierarchical order. 


### *User Stories*

- As a user, I want to be able to add a new session to my log of sessions
- As a user, I want to be able to view my overall mastery rate
- As a user, I want to be able to view a summary of my completed sessions
- As a user, I want to be able to view my topic efficiency for each study session
